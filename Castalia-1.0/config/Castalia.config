#
# Config file for the Castalia simulator framework on Linux and other Unix-like systems. 
# Not used on Windows/MSVC. 
#
# This gets included by every makefile.
# 
#
# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# Please re-generate omnetppconfig before trying to build Castalia!
# The command is:  opp_makemake -f --genconfig omnetpp.config
#


# include omnetppconfig from this directory
# example of ROOT FOR Castalia : 
 ROOT = $(HOME)/Desktop/Castalia-1.0
#ROOT= /PATH_TO_CASTALIA/Castalia-1.0

CONFIGDIR = $(ROOT)/config

include $(CONFIGDIR)/omnetpp.config



# If you need to add some extra CFLAGS, ICLUDE_PATH, LIBS inside the automatically produced Makefiles (at each directory of the ../src/ folder)
# uncomment the following lines and modify them as you wish
#CFLAGS+= 
#INCLUDE_PATH+= ...additional include directories (for header files *.h)...
#LIBS+= ...additional libs and lib directories...
